1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,980
To help make your drive times smoother
and safer on the M80 Ring Road,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,820
we're delivering a $300 million upgrade
from Sunshine Avenue to the Calder Freeway,

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,960
which will cut your travel time by 15 minutes.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,400
We're adding two lanes each way
to get rid of the bottlenecks at

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,440
Sunshine Avenue, Keilor Park Drive
and the Calder Freeway.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,060
Without disrupting traffic in peak periods,
we're widening the EJ Whitten Bridge

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,160
to provide five lanes in each direction.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,520
Public safety barriers, similar to those on the West Gate,

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,800
will make the bridge safer for pedestrians and cyclists.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,980
And a new freeway management system
will provide you with better information

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,820
so you can spend less time in traffic
and more time where you need to be.
