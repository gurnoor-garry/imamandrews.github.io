Doing reading.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,220
Because there are all my favourite pictures or words.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,540
Making sounds and spelling them.

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,980

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,940
learning.

Seeing our friends again.

00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,060

or two.

22

If someone touches us, it means we have to catch them as fast as we can.

00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,140
If we touch them, it means it's their turn to catch us.
