1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,560
TBMs are used around the world

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,900
including London,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,940
New York,

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,780
Malaysia,

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,780
and Singapore.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,240
The rotating cutter head excavates through the ground.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,800
A conveyor belt or pipe carries the excavated rock and soil to the back of the tunnel boring machine.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,620
Vehicles can then transport the material out of the tunnel.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,000
Precast concrete segments line and support the tunnel floor.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,080
TBMs can measure more than 100 metres in length,

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,480
move about 10 metres per day,

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,620
and weigh up to 1,000 tonnes.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,860
Construction on this massive city-shaping project begins soon

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,220
with the tunnelling work starting in 2018.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,120
Melbourne needs the Metro Tunnel

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,980
and the best construction companies in the world will build it.
