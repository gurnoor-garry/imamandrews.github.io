1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,040
Last year, we took a positive plan
to the people of Victoria.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,600
With this year's Budget, we're delivering
on that plan, and delivering on our promises.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,680
Before we came to government,

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,700
we promised to remove 50 of our most dangerous
and congested levels crossing by 2022.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,120
With 29 crossings already gone for good,

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,180
now we’re getting on with removing even more –

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:32,600
investing $6.6 billion dollars to remove
a total of 75 level crossings by 2025.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,580
Getting Victorians out of traffic and home sooner.

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,960
We’re delivering the Suburban Transport Blitz –

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,680
transforming suburban rail, upgrading suburban
roads, and fully funding North East Link.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,540
Just like we said we would.

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,220
We’re investing in regional Victoria too –

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,800
fixing regional roads, building more regional trains,

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,840
and doing it using local workers and local materials.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,720
From fixing the roundabout at the end of your street
to building our state’s biggest transport projects,

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,860
this Budget will get you where you need to go.

17
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,500
We also promised to put power back in the
hands of Victorians,

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,820
and by installing solar on more than 700,000 homes, that’s exactly what we’re doing.

19
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,880
We’re building and fixing our hospitals,
and investing in healthy smiles for our kids,

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,380
with the rollout of free dental
for students across the state.

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,160
And because Victorians deserve
quality care wherever they live,

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:43,020
we’re delivering 500,000 extra appointments for
medical specialists for patients in regional Victoria.

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,320
Bringing your baby home for the first time is
one of the most precious and daunting moments

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,620
for any parent.

25
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,680
With this Budget, we’re making sure new
parents have the support they need.

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,700
with new parenting centres and new baby
bundles for our youngest Victorians.

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,580
We’re making sure those same young Victorians
get the very best start in life –

28
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,800
building better classrooms,
17 brand-new schools,

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,220
and rolling out three-year-old kinder
for every Victorian child.

30
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,140
These are the things we said we would do.

31
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,380
And with this Budget, we’re keeping our promises

32
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,060
and delivering for all Victorians.
