1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,460
The Mernda rail extension will meet the needs
of one of Victoria's fastest growing regions

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,510
by helping to connect local people to work, study
and important services right across Melbourne.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,020
The project will extend the South Morang
rail line with the construction of 8 kilometres

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,900
of new railway to the proposed Mernda Town Centre.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,720
And it will feature three new state-of-the-art stations.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,500
We've developed a design that
reflects local feedback by including

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,600
an additional station at Hawkestowe
that the community asked for,

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,640
providing 2000 carparks,
400 more than originally planned,

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,940
and by keeping the majority of
the new rail at ground level.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,560
We're improving walking and cycling
connectivity with a new shared used path,

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,880
connecting South Morang to Mernda
and all the stations in between.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,480
The new station at Marymede
will be built at ground level

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,800
and will connect into the local
walking and cycling path network.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,980
It has a spacious landscaped forecourt,
which offers a series of relaxing spaces to meet

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,320
before catching the train.

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,400
The new line passes under busy
Plenty Road as it heads further north.

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,760
Through the use of two underpasses
and three rail bridges,

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,420
the Mernda rail extension avoids
the construction of any level crossings.

19
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,160
A new station at Hawkestowe will have
up to 350 parking spaces for commuters

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,320
and provide uninterrupted views over Plenty Gorge Park.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,860
Sensitive urban design and landscaping
near residential areas will minimise noise

22
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,240
and improve amenity for the local community.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,300
Neighbouring the proposed town centre,
the premium station at Mernda will provide

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,160
a fully integrated transport hub that is expected to service 5000 passengers each day.

25
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,420
The Mernda rail extension will
begin construction in early 2017

26
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,060
and will be open to commuters in 2019.
