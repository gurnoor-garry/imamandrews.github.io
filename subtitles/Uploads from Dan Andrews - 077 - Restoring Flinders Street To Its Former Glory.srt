00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,880
Last year, the Government announced a
$100 million upgrade to Flinders Street Station.

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,820
That's partly because it's a great
icon of Melbourne and Victoria,

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,280
but it's also a really important part
of our public transport network.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,320
It's a station that has more than 26 million
passenger trips through it every single year.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,080
It's a busy station, it's a grand station,

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,440
and we're wanting to restore its facade in particular.

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,520
Our role in the Flinders Street Station project has
been to survey and assess the condition of the building,

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,120
and in particular to investigate the original
decoration or paint treatment to the building.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,980
We were able to establish from newspaper
accounts that it's been painted at least 5 times

10
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,760
since it was originally painted
around the early 1910s, 1915 period.

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,500
To assist with the analysis, we employed the
Grimwade Centre for Cultural Materials Conservation,

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,220
which is based at Melbourne University.

13
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,620
Their role was primarily to sort out what the
inorganic material was in the paint systems,

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,600
so that would assist us in
establishing what the colours were.

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,700
We started by first taking many, many samples
from a representative component of the building.

16
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,680
We then embed those samples in the polyester resin.

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,760
And then we slice the resin so we can actually see
all the layers, so it's like looking at this wonderful

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,440
multilayered liquorice allsort.

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,280
The next stage was to take the samples to
earth sciences at the University of Melbourne.

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,880
And we have equipment there
called a scanning electron microscope.

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,940
It's very high resolution, very high magnification.

22
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:57,800
We're able to do an inorganic analysis of the
pigment particles, so that gives us further information

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,820
about what colour we're dealing with over the years.

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,560
What was really interesting is that the analysis
showed us that all of the paints were, in a sense,

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,580
commercial paints that you would expect
of the period when the building was repainted.

26
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,840
So the building, while shades have varied, has been typically repainted consistently in stone colours

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,500
to the render and dark greens to the woodwork.

28
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,000
Before state registered buildings, the preference
is that the color schemes be investigated,

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,880
and if the original colour scheme is important or important to the architecture of the building,

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,180
typically their preference is that it
be repainted in the original scheme.

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,600
I'm really pleased to announce that part
of this restoration of Flinders Street Station

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,780
involves the repainting of the facade,

33
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,720
and that is going to be done in the original 1910 colours that Flinders Street Station was originally painted in.
