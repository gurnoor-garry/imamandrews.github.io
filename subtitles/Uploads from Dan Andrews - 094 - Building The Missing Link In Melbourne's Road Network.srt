1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,740
The Victorian Government will build the North East Link,

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,020
finally completing the missing
link in Melbourne’s road network.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,000
After almost 50 years of disconnected freeways,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,720
the North East Link will connect the M80 Ring Road

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,360
to the Eastern Freeway and EastLink.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,400
Expected to carry more than 100,000 vehicles a day,

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
the project will connect the millions of people
living in Melbourne’s north, east and south-east

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,160
to jobs, schools and hospitals,

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,300
slash travel times and congestion
in Melbourne’s northern suburbs,

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,800
take trucks off local roads, with better
access between key industrial centres

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,500
and a connection from the east to the airport,

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,720
create thousands of jobs during construction,

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,000
and protect our suburbs and the
environment with advanced tunneling.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,300
Planning and consultation will start in 2017,

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,100
with a chance for Victorians to have their say

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,500
on the best way to get this project done.
