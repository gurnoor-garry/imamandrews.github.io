1
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:07,840
This year’s Budget is focused on building
on the new found strength of the Victorian

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:14,570
economy to deliver the things that matter
most to Victorians: hospitals, schools, jobs

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:21,619
and transport to protect our quality of life.
The Budget funds our plans, projects and promises

4
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:27,449
because getting things done means concrete
delivery, not dithering and delay.

5
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,809
We’re building the projects our state needs
and creating thousands of jobs.

6
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:38,309
We’re supporting businesses to grow and
making sure Victorians get the skills they

7
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,629
need.
The Budget sets aside $500 million to take

8
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,629
action family violence – our number one
law and order issue.

9
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:51,589
It will deliver more new schools than ever
before.

10
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:57,100
It will cut waiting times for emergency departments
and elective surgeries.

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,769
It funds the road and rail projects we need
to get to work and home on time.

12
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:09,170
And it recognises regional Victoria as key
to our state’s economic strength.

13
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,530
With this Budget, regional cities can start
to rival Melbourne in the race for new jobs,

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,680
visitors and businesses – and that’s a
good thing.

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,070
Make no mistake: our economy is strong.
Companies who want to invest in Victoria and

16
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:30,079
create new jobs now know they have a government
that’s on their side and the Victorian economy

17
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,890
has a new-found confidence.
They are just some of the reasons why our

18
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,740
state is growing faster than any other.
It’s our job to manage this growth, and

19
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,909
make sure no Victorian misses out on the things
that really matter.

20
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:51,569
It will take time and effort, but I’m proud
to say that we’re getting it done.
