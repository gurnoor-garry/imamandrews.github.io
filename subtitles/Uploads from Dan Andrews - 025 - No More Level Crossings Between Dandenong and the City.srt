1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,240
The Victorian Government is removing nine
dangerous and congested level crossings and

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,680
rebuilding five stations along Melbourne's
busiest train line, the Cranbourne-Pakenham line.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,780
Boom gates can be down for up to 87
minutes during the two-hour morning peak,

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,520
crippling the road network, dividing communities
and putting safety at risk.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,920
Getting rid of these relics of the past will improve safety
and reduce congestion.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,140
By separating the road and rail network through three sections of elevated rail,

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:45,380
this innovative and modern design will remove the barrier between communities and create 225,000 square metres

8
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,740
of linear park, equivalent to over 11 MCGs. With new
community spaces and parklands, and new carparking,

9
00:00:53,740 --> 00:01:00,140
the existing rail corridor will be opened
up to the community and transformed into a vibrant public space.

10
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,600
A new pedestrian and
bicycle network will connect 12 kilometres

11
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,219
of continual paths and include up to seven
new community activity spaces.

12
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:10,219


13
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:15,579
The innovative design significant reduces
the impact of construction. The new rail line

14
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:20,289
can be constructed while trains are still
running, greatly minimising the impact on

15
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:26,960
both road and rail users. The new Murrumbeena
Station will be integrated with the existing

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,710
village precinct with improved interchanges
between transport modes and bicycle facilities

17
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:38,780
to promote active communities. The design
minimises impacts on the local environment

18
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,880
by retaining large amounts of mature and locally-significant vegetation.

19
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:53,500
At Clayton Station, the design solution creates new community open spaces,
an open civic plaza and an integrated bus

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:00,020
interchange that will improve connections
to Monash Health and Monash University's Clayton campus.

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,200
The elevated rail allows for new car parking to be introduced across the whole

22
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:19,450
project corridor, including over 300 car parks
around Clayton Station. The proposed design

23
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,760
delivers a new Noble Park Station closer to
Heatherton Road to better integrate with the

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,290
Douglas Street activity centre. The design
makes it easier for pedestrians to get to

25
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:38,709
the Noble Park RSL, the Aquatic Centre and
Ross Reserve. A new road from Leonard Avenue

26
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:44,590
to Ian Street will connect the northern and
southern precincts. A new village plaza and

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,980
station forecourt with public seating will
be large enough to accomodate community activities.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,580
The design will reduce the overall noise from trains.

29
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:05,040
It will deliver a more reliable train service with a 42% increase in capacity.

30
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,800
The project will create 2,000 jobs and fully open in 2018.

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,720
Removing these nine level crossings, building five new stations and opening up communities

32
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,940
will reduce traffic congestion, improve safety and improve the way in which we live.
