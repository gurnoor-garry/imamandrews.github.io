1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,980
Just two degrees.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,339
It might not sound like a lot – but a two
degree increase in global temperatures would

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,560
change everything.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:16,420
An extra two degrees means we risk more extreme
weather, heat waves, rising sea levels and drought.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,779
If it's to be stopped, every nation and
every government has a role to play.

6
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:25,239
That begins with reducing our emissions.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,940
We have a plan, but we need your help too.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,940
TAKE2 is Victoria's commitment to reach
zero emissions by 2050.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,500
The Victorian Government will be doing its
share with targets for 2020 and every five

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,580
years after that.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,560
We'll make the Climate Change Act the strongest
in Australia.

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:53,340
We'll build a clean energy economy, because supporting
renewable energy means supporting jobs.

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,100
And, of course, we'll help households and businesses to
save energy and save money.

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,380
But TAKE2 is about collective climate change
action.

15
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:12,880
That means all of us – individuals, communities,
businesses – we all have a responsibility.

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,080
It's time to get real about climate change –
for this generation, and the generations to come.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,940
We need to do more.

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,880
And we need to do it now.

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,440
It's time for us all to TAKE2, at take2.vic.gov.au
