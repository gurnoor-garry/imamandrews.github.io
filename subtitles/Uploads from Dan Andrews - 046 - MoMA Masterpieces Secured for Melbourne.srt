00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,890
Melbourne's scored a major coup with New York's
Museum of Modern Art to send some of its famous

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:11,549
works to the NGV. Daniel Andrews helped secure
the deal, which he believes will break gallery

3
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:16,649
attendance records. State political reporter
Andrew Lund is travelling with him.

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:23,609
New York's Museum of Modern Art – home to the
likes of Van Gogh, Cézanne, Dalí and Lichtenstein.

5
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,980
This is one of the greatest collections in
the world.

6
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:27,769
In a coup made possible by some

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:34,520
personal intervention from Premier Daniel Andrews,
150 of those works are set to travel to Melbourne.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,570
This is a roll call of the greatest names
and the greatest works in contemporary art

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,410
and they're all coming to Melbourne.

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:49,020
They'll be on display at the NGV from June to October 2018 as part of the Winter Masterpieces.

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,440
Many of the works rarely travel.

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,059
Loans that are literally painful to make because we have
an audience here that comes to see certain

13
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,969
paintings and many of those will be in Melbourne,
so we hope they will travel there to see them.

14
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,429
The Premier is hoping the collection will
prove a tourism boom. This will break all

15
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:10,260
This will break all records. This will be such a significant show.

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,740
This will get several hundred thousand people easily.

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,600
Earlier, Daniel Andrews was guest
of honour at the New York Stock Exchange for

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,140
a briefing on the art of making money. The
Premier used the visit to tout for investment

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,320
and highlight Victoria's infrastructure agenda,
in particular the Metro Rail Tunnel and

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,799
Western Distributor, which are both out to
market. But while Daniel Andrews had poll

21
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,810
position for the opening, it was Indy 500
winner Alexander Rossi given the honour of

22
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,170
ringing the bell.

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,980
