1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
I begin by acknowledging the traditional

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,211
owners of the land on which we meet and

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,339
pay my respects to their elders past and

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,329
present

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:19,249
delegates I say it and I mean it because

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,469
I'm not acknowledging a lifestyle choice

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:34,919
I'm acknowledging the oldest continuous

8
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:37,408
culture known to human history can we

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,019
think our deputy leader our deputy

10
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:43,288
premier for his words today and he's

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:50,789
work in making Victoria the education

12
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:52,619
state in the room today of course can we

13
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,378
also welcome party president Rupert

14
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:59,128
Evans and state secretary Noah Carol

15
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:02,368
fresh off a win Noah was the campaign

16
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:04,288
director but he knows we couldn't have

17
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:07,529
done it without the members of our

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:12,179
campaign team the members of our

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:16,289
Community Action Network to everyone who

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:20,640
filled a shift work the phones knocked

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:24,389
on doors and stood on street corners to

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,080
every man and woman young and old who

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,409
gave their time and their toil to a

24
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:37,848
cause that's greater than us all our

25
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,849
party says thank you and I say thank you

26
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:50,449
so every nurse every firefighter and

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,870
every paramedic teacher and tradie who

28
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:57,169
joined us - every candidate every

29
00:01:53,870 --> 00:02:00,910
delegate every colleague every member of

30
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:06,1000
our movement every member of a union I

31
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:06,998
was proud to stand by your side

32
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,210
delegates I said on election night that

33
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:23,139
some wanted an election all about unions

34
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:34,399
all about workers and their families and

35
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:36,139
that's exactly what they got during that

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,130
campaign we rallied with the people

37
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:43,129
who'd been left behind we stood up for

38
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:45,348
the families who were failed we spoke to

39
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:47,928
the kids who wanted a skill who wanted a

40
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:52,908
job who wanted to build a better life

41
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:57,410
for themselves with their own hands we

42
00:02:52,909 --> 00:03:00,889
put people first and they gave us a

43
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:03,678
great responsibility the right to form a

44
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:07,669
strong and stable majority labor

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,939
government the people of Victoria didn't

46
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:13,779
just change the government they started

47
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:16,299
something that will change our state

48
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,100
they asked for better schools and

49
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:23,509
stronger tapes to give their kids a

50
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:27,229
chance they asked for more trains and

51
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:30,199
fewer level crossings to get home safer

52
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:32,509
and sooner they asked for a health

53
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:36,349
system that cares for them and the

54
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:40,669
people they love and today I can tell

55
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:43,398
you we are getting on with it one of the

56
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:46,579
proudest moments of my professional life

57
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,279
came on the first day of our labor

58
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,299
government I was down at some Vincent's

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,318
Hospital with a dozen or so paramedics

60
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,650
like our fire five

61
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:01,938
and nurses paramedics carry a weight

62
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:05,539
that most of us could not but there was

63
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:10,158
a time not too long ago when their own

64
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:14,499
government their own employer abused

65
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:19,068
them attacked them and betrayed them

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:23,359
paramedics and their patients lives were

67
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:25,998
lost and it simply had to stop that's

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,119
why on the first day of our government I

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:35,589
stood side-by-side with those women and

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,589
men and proudly declared war is over

71
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:48,409
today delegates we're working with

72
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:52,340
paramedics not against them to save the

73
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:55,219
minutes that save lives and we've begun

74
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:58,968
the hard work to recruit additional

75
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:04,899
firefighters to equip them to protect

76
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,899
them because after all they protect us

77
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:20,460
and the dangerous and perhaps deadly

78
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:29,909
fisk ville training center it has closed

79
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:33,417
for good today

80
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,749
Victoria's nurses and midwives have for

81
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:38,418
the first time in four years a

82
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,849
government that respects their work

83
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:43,918
today the emergency funds are flowing

84
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,830
into our TAFE system bringing our

85
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,969
campuses back from the brink helping

86
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:53,248
them survive and helping them to thrive

87
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,979
and today we're harnessing the power of

88
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,910
the government's purchase to secure

89
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:02,548
local jobs and local skills because

90
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,850
we're focused on employment growth right

91
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:08,750
here in Victoria not on the other side

92
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,749
of the world

93
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:19,468
friends were getting our state back to

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,340
work we're getting our transport system

95
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:27,960
back on track medical cannabis is one

96
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:36,778
step closer adoption equality is one

97
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:40,228
step closer water is flowing into Lake

98
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:49,887
to londo and cattle out of the high

99
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:59,157
country northern Metrorail will be part

100
00:06:49,889 --> 00:07:03,020
of our future and deadly level crossings

101
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:03,019
will be part of our past

102
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:12,299
delegates at our last state conference I

103
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:15,418
gave the most important speech I've ever

104
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,269
given I announced our plan to establish

105
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:21,448
Australia's first Royal Commission into

106
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:25,078
the country's number one law and order

107
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:29,038
crisis Family Violence our national

108
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:32,508
emergency and today I can inform you

109
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:45,388
that that Royal Commission is fully

110
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:49,138
underway it will give us the answers we

111
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:52,469
need because I know that more of the

112
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:57,898
same policy will mean more of the same

113
00:07:52,468 --> 00:08:03,378
tragedy we have led the way we will make

114
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:03,379
the change and that will save lives

115
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,179
the Royal Commission came from speaking

116
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,970
with thousands of Victorians those comp

117
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,359
those conversations convinced me that we

118
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:25,559
had to act but they also convinced me

119
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:29,459
that outcomes for women start with

120
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:33,029
attitudes toward women and that's what I

121
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:34,917
want to talk to you about today let me

122
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:37,619
tell you about some of the public

123
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:41,129
institutions that help our state get

124
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,759
things done hospitals the guardians of

125
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:48,148
our health courts the guardians of our

126
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:51,449
justice system types and universities

127
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:54,118
the guardians of our future from the

128
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:58,560
Commission's and agencies and services

129
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,230
that review reform and make sure no one

130
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:04,349
misses out to the galleries and museums

131
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:07,289
that make us the cultural capital of

132
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:10,260
Australia these are the organisations

133
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:14,098
that dictate the day-to-day lives of

134
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:17,308
every Victorian their success determines

135
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:21,060
ours as a state their performance

136
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:24,688
determines ours as a people so it

137
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:28,139
concerns me it really does when they

138
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,449
aren't as good as they can be when they

139
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:33,688
aren't representative of the people they

140
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,869
serve it concerns me when their

141
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:40,560
leadership doesn't reflect contemporary

142
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,629
Victoria many of the boardrooms of our

143
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,688
public bodies are lacking a balance of

144
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:49,829
skills a balance of views

145
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:52,400
a balance of experiences a balance of

146
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:55,679
knowledge because they're lacking

147
00:09:52,399 --> 00:10:01,338
perhaps the most important balance of

148
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,337
all delegates they're lacking women

149
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,920
now a lot of people in this room made a

150
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,409
lot of noise when Tony Abbot found only

151
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,718
one seat that his cabinet table to

152
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:23,849
represent more than 11 million

153
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,519
Australian women but but we're fooling

154
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:30,720
ourselves if we think the problem starts

155
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:33,648
and ends there our cabinet is very

156
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,179
different and I'm very proud of that

157
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:38,729
but understand this when it comes to

158
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:41,488
women on major government boards the

159
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,789
federal government performs better than

160
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:48,570
Victoria and I'm not very proud of that

161
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:51,808
at all and it's even worse because we're

162
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:54,119
going backwards female representation on

163
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:57,059
major government boards in Victoria has

164
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,499
fallen from 40 percent to a little over

165
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:03,658
35 percent in just four years

166
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:07,110
delegates consider these facts in

167
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:09,659
Victoria women make up 80 percent of the

168
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,390
workforce in the health and social care

169
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:15,328
sector but the proportion of women on

170
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:18,568
the board of Melbourne health less than

171
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,839
a quarter women make up 69 percent of

172
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,249
the workforce in education and training

173
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,789
but the proportion of women on the

174
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:29,459
council at RMIT and Victoria University

175
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:31,769
less than a third more Victorian women

176
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:36,389
are graduating from university than men

177
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:39,479
here in the ideas capital but Melbourne

178
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:42,408
University proportionally it has fewer

179
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,560
female council members than any other

180
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:50,428
university in Australia and it doesn't

181
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:53,337
it doesn't in there public transport

182
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:56,938
Victoria less than a fifth of its board

183
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,399
are women Treasury Corporation less than

184
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,310
a quarter the country fire authority

185
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,488
less than a quarter the supreme and

186
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:10,289
county courts less than a third of our

187
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:14,599
judges are women but all of this it

188
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:16,888
isn't their fault it is indeed our fault

189
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,029
government appointments after all are

190
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:24,169
made by the government now we do have it

191
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:26,668
an intention an aspiration a

192
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:28,888
well-meaning goal for better

193
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:31,409
representation on all government boards

194
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:37,019
it was implemented some six years ago

195
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:39,359
and yet we're going backwards and I say

196
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:42,358
this morning I am tired of targets like

197
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,260
these becoming an increasingly eloquent

198
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,890
measure of our failure it's time to turn

199
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:53,398
that target into something tangible it

200
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:56,509
is something real that's why I can

201
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:00,089
announce today delegates but from now on

202
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:03,839
under our labor government no less than

203
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:07,229
50% of all future appointments to all

204
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:10,849
paid government boards and all Victorian

205
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,850
courts will be women

206
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:45,470
it is not it is not a target it is not

207
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:49,409
an aspiration

208
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:52,168
it's an assurance of all the

209
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:56,517
appointments that my government makes

210
00:13:52,168 --> 00:14:00,388
between now and November 2018 including

211
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:04,230
all judges and magistrates at least one

212
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:14,879
half of them will be women and I will be

213
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:18,028
accountable for that delegates this is a

214
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:21,329
step forward for our state public

215
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:24,688
institutions that actually represent the

216
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:27,177
public that means balance it means

217
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:29,788
better decisions that means reaching

218
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:32,038
deeper into a growing pool of talent

219
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:34,468
training more people from different

220
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:38,247
backgrounds to become leaders of our

221
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:41,220
state now we talked about the lack of

222
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:44,069
women on corporate boards well this is

223
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,859
the first step to fix it I'm not going

224
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:49,678
to tell companies how to run their

225
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:51,899
affairs but I do have something to say

226
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:54,958
about this attitude that there aren't

227
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:59,278
enough qualified women going around I

228
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:01,708
don't agree with that I simply don't but

229
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:05,327
even if you accept that argument isn't

230
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:07,887
it time that we did something about it

231
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:09,587
what I've announced today will mean that

232
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:13,018
by the end of 2018

233
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:15,268
no director of an asx200 company will be

234
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,818
able to look me in the eye and tell me

235
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:20,578
that there aren't enough women in our

236
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:24,108
state who are qualified to sit around

237
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:24,107
their boardroom tables

238
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,578
delegates this is no token gesture it's

239
00:15:34,578 --> 00:15:40,549
very real because I am sick and tired of

240
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:44,539
attending big meetings where the only

241
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:47,688
people there are blokes how does that

242
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:51,197
help the progress of our states how does

243
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:54,170
that guarantee the best decisions how

244
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:57,799
does that influence the culture of an

245
00:15:54,169 --> 00:16:00,319
organization for the better the fact is

246
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:05,087
when organizations lose diversity they

247
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:09,620
lose touch and eventually we all lose

248
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:13,909
out because bad attitudes produce bad

249
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:19,279
results not just in organizations but in

250
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:24,828
our society some are obvious some are

251
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:28,879
hidden some are destructive all of them

252
00:16:24,828 --> 00:16:31,879
need to be challenged that's why I want

253
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,609
to make it very clear to you today that

254
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,569
under this Labour government equality is

255
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,570
not negotiable

256
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:53,649
delegates last year's election was not

257
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:55,509
simply about defeating our opponents it

258
00:16:53,649 --> 00:17:00,668
was all about winning the right to

259
00:16:55,509 --> 00:17:04,268
govern to reform rebuild and reshape our

260
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:07,598
state to make sure that every Victorian

261
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:12,148
can reach their full potential because

262
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:14,889
only then will we all reach ours

263
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:18,569
Victorians voted for a positive plan and

264
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:21,640
the team with the energy to deliver it

265
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:25,569
they voted for better schools and better

266
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:29,130
hospitals better public transport they

267
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:34,539
voted for skills for jobs for action on

268
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:39,340
family violence they voted to put people

269
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:44,519
first and friends make no mistake we are

270
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:44,518
getting on with it thank you very much

271
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,550
you
