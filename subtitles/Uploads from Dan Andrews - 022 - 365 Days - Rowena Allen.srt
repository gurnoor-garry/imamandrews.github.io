My name is Rowena Allen. I'm Victoria's first
Commissioner for Gender and Sexuality. So

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,080
basically that means I work with lesbian,
gay, bisexual, trans, gender diverse and

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,630
intersex Victorians. I'm excited about how
the position of Gender and Sexuality Commissioner

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,000
has been warmly welcomed in Victoria. It's
a fantastic state to live with such a progressive

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,100
government that is being so inclusive and
welcoming for LGBTI Victorians. I've been

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,710
an advocate in the LGBTI space for the last
20 years and I started the first support group

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,790
for rural same-sex attracted young people
in Victoria up in Shepparton. My job is one

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,640
of education and advocacy, and doing that,
I work with sporting groups, corporate groups,

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,650
community groups right across Victoria to
make sure we make Victoria a really safe place

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,760
to live. I've had a lot of contact from people
in other states about how they get a Commissioner

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,580
for Gender and Sexuality â€“ Victoria is absolutely
leading the way in inclusive practice.
