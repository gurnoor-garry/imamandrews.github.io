1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,080
Metro Tunnel benefits commuters right across the network

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,900
so it doesn't matter if you're in Sunshine, Sandringham, or Seymour,

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,740
everyone benefits from the Metro Tunnel.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,820
And it will also deliver significant extra capacity

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,080
so at the peak time, we will see an additional 39,000 commuters

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,320
use this new system every single day.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,320
We are fully funding this project. Every single dollar.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,320
To deliver this $10.9 billion project, it has been put into

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,860
various packages of work and we're releasing today

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,120
the contract for the biggest package of work.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,560
It's constructing two 9 kilometre tunnels and 5 underground stations for the Metro Tunnel.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,860
It's project that has national priority status from Infrastructure Australia.

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,680
It's the project that's going to unlock the capacity

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,820
for Victoria's entire public transport network.

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,880
Well, yesterday's announcement of the funding is actually going to

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,680
be very good timing for us because it will add a lot of confidence

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,660
to the process we're going through at the moment in trying to engage with the market

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,180
and attract as broadly as possible their interest in the project.
