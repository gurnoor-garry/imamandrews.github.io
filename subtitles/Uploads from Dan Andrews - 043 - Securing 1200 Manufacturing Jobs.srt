Qantas has confirmed it will use Melbourne
as a training base for pilots on its new 787s

ahead of their delivery next year. It came
as the Premier marked a Victorian manufacturing

milestone at Boeing's headquarters near Seattle.

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,860
Boeing's Everett Factory is the world's biggest building
by volume, but to build the high-tech 787,

5
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,369
the company relies on help from Melbourne.

6
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:32,729
Boeing Australia builds important components for the 787. The flaps at the trailing edge of the wing are an

7
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,049
important component to the aerodynamics.

8
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:39,420
It's a Victorian manufacturing
success story the Premier was keen to promote

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,670
as he was given a guided tour of the giant
plant, his visit coinciding with the 500th

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,950
shipment from Melbourne.

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:53,780
Without the high-tech expertise of Melbourne workers, the Dreamliner simply wouldn't get off the ground.

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,880
Earlier this year, Boeing announced plans to cut thousands

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,700
of jobs from its commercial aircraft division.
But after meeting with company executives,

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,700
Daniel Andrews is confident the Fishermans
Bend plant and its 1200 employees have a bright future.

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,780
Something like $500 million worth of investment in the last 15 years. They're here to stay.

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,560
Qantas has ordered 8 of the
787-9 variant and has confirmed it will use

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,540
a high-tech simulator based in Melbourne to help train its pilots.

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,200
Just to have a terrific simulator in Melbourne, we want to use that to its maximum capacity.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,380
Qantas is due to take delivery of its first Dreamliner in the second half of next year. The airline says

20
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,990
it's still working to finalise the aircraft's
interior fit out and is yet to confirm exactly

21
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,690
where it will fly. The Government hopes the
Victorian components will make regular returns

22
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,560
to Melbourne as the new planes open up links
with the rest of the world.
