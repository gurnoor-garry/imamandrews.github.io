1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,720
It's not just the physical injuries – you
have to learn to cope with that.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,440
It's the sheer waste and the stench of alcohol that stays with you.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,140
PHONE: I'm just ringing to inform you that your daughter Lucy has been involved in a car accident.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,140
You'll need to come down.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,860
MAN: This is not even about her, you know – the car's smashed.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,960
(Inaudible)

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,620
MAN: This is the driver.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,040
DOCTOR: That looks very messy.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,420
DOCTOR: You can't go in there at the moment, mate.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,620
MAN: I've got to go in there.

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,860
DOCTOR: Want to come with us?

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,320
We'll just have a chat to you for a second.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,060
MOTHER: Is she alright?

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,020
DOCTOR: She's okay for the moment.

15
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,580
DOCTOR: Her left leg has been damaged quite severely.

16
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,260
There's a possibility that she may lose that leg.

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,940
DOCTOR: We'll also scan her head to look at whether there's any head injury as well.

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,560
KAREN: They drink too much, and then they drive.

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,800
They smash up their cars and the people they're supposed to care about.

20
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,400
And if they survive, they're the ones that have to live with that.

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,940
And that's the real tragedy.

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,880
If you drink, then drive, you're a bloody idiot.
