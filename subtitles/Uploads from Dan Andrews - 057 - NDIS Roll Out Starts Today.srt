00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:09,820
Michelle and I had been together two years.
We decided that we wanted to move in together

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,839
and yeah we bought the land out at Berwick
and decided to build a house. So I was kinda

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,740
lucky that with NDIS helping set up the house
with the modifications and doorways being

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,660
widened. The ensuite bathroom was completely
changed around to be able to allow an open

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:36,410
shower. There’s handrails in both bathrooms.
They’ve also paid to have the kitchen bench

6
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,490
to be lowered and extended to allow me to
do things at the sink.

7
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,160
When I did my interview with the case planner,
you know he asked me do I drive and I’m

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,260
like, no, and he’s like, well why not? So
I went and had some driving lessons and started

9
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,380
driving again just using a spinner knob modification
on the steering wheel. We can go on holidays

10
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,989
now and you know not have to worry about sort
of having personal support and things like that.

11
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,979
I think that that’s a big thing for
me has always been getting that independence

12
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,790
to be able to sort of live the life that I
want to live.
