1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,510
We're getting on with the job.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,020
And this year's Budget delivers on the things
that really matter.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,080
We're building better roads

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,800
and public transport.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,360
Because Victorians need options
they can rely on, wherever they live.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,200
We're removing more level crossings.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,780
Making more trains and trams for Victorians

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,840
in Victoria.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,660
And we're building new roads to make your drive

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,760
safer and faster.

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,200
Victoria now leads the nation in jobs growth

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,060
and we'll create even more across the state.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,140
We'll make sure every region shares in our
success

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,860
and we'll revive regional rail to connect
communities and create more jobs.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,540
We'll ease the burden on small business

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,190
and we'll keep investing in skills, apprentices

17
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,220
and attracting new industries and new jobs.

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,660
In an emergency, all we want is for our families
to get fast and first-class care.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,640
That's why we're delivering better hospitals

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,530
shorter waiting lists

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,720
and an ambulance service Victorians can count on.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,719
There will be thousands more police on the
beat as well

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,460
with the powers and the equipment they need
to fight crime and keep Victoria safe.

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,310
We're putting more teachers into better classrooms.

25
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,979
Upgrading and building new schools right across Victoria.

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,869
And for our youngest Victorians, we're making
sure our kinders are properly funded.

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,000
And that every child gets the best start in
life.

28
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:45,000
I promised I would do everything I could to
keep women and their children safe.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,100
That I would change it all when it comes to
family violence.

30
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,700
And that's what this budget does.

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,859
Protecting the vulnerable

32
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,920
punishing the guilty.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,389
There's more in this year's budget than ever
before to deal with the number one law and

34
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:03,560
order issue in our state and in our nation.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,340
And that is family violence.

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,539
More jobs.

37
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:08,990
Better schools.

38
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,260
World-class hospitals.

39
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,280
More police on the beat.

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,310
Better roads.

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,840
And public transport that actually works.

42
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,019
These are the things that really matter.

43
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:24,159
For every Victorian, wherever you live.

44
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,819
That's what we were elected to do.

45
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,860
And we are getting on with the job.
