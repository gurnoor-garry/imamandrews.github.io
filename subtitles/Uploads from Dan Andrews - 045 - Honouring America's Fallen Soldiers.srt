2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,059
fallen soldiers. He's also spoken out in support

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,400
crackdown on violent masked thugs.
Brendan Donohoe is travelling with the Premier.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,060
The Premier started the day with vegemite on toast
at the Australian-owned Bluestone Cafe before

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,170
joining the front row VIPs at the annual Memorial
Day commemoration.

6
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,460
It's a federal holiday

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:43,290
and the most sombre as it remembers the 1.2
million American men and women killed in armed

8
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,810
conflicts, including World Wars I and II,
Korea, Vietnam, the Middle East and Afghanistan.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,920
US Navy chief Admiral John Richardson and
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio appreciated

10
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,930
the support from down under, with the Premier
invited to lay a wreath in the memory of Allied

11
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,670
soldiers killed fighting along with the United States.

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,560
It's a great honour to be here today

13
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,170
to remember those who have fallen in the defence
of our freedom, for our whole world.

14
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,100
On home-grown law and order issues,

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,680
the Premier announced he supports the Chief Commissioner, Graham Ashton,

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,200
and new laws to ban violent thugs
wearing masks at public protests and other events.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,380
The powers necessary, the resources
necessary, that's how we'll fight crime and

18
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,170
keep our Victorian community safe.

19
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,770
The Premier says any changes to the law will be decided when he returns to Victoria after a 10-day tour

20
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,190
through the United States.

00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,870
