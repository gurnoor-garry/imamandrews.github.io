1
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:11,999
today we're announcing 100 million

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,799
dollars in new money to bring forward

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,139
the planning not of one or two of these

4
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,028
50 but of all 50 level crossings that

5
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:20,277
are holding us back something as

6
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:22,379
significant as this also requires a

7
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:23,999
dedicated focus and that's why we're

8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:25,738
also announcing today along with that

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,009
one hundred million dollars in new money

10
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,378
on this program we're also announcing

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,920
the level crossing removal Authority a

12
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,348
dedicated team of experts engineers

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,689
surveyors all those who've got the

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,119
skills and the knowledge and the

15
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,339
understanding to make sure that we get

16
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,968
on and deliver on our commitment in full

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,210
on time and get the best value for

18
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:54,058
Victorian taxpayers so this is all about

19
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:56,339
better and safer roads people being able

20
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,168
to move throughout the community that

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,519
they've helped to build so it's about

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,530
dealing with congestion improving safety

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,869
creating jobs but also they shouldn't

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,989
forget this will allow us to run more

25
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:12,688
trains more often if you were to run

26
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,969
additional trains without removing these

27
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:17,668
level crossings then in many instances

28
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:20,007
boom gates would be down for 50 minutes

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,500
across the morning and afternoon peaks

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,489
that would be a completely unacceptable

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,908
set of circumstances we'd finish up with

32
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:32,878
absolute traffic chaos this is a really

33
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,859
exciting and ambitious agenda this is

34
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,848
about addressing congestion issues it's

35
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:40,258
about improving safety it's also about

36
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:42,719
looking at how we can put more train

37
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,489
services into our public transport

38
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,768
system to provide additional services

39
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:48,477
for passengers right across Melbourne

40
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:50,639
but it's also about looking at other

41
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,349
economic development opportunities and

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,809
that's a tremendously exciting part of

43
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,039
this project the project itself is going

44
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,258
to create around four and a half

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,169
thousand jobs but we want to look at how

46
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,630
we can work with businesses communities

47
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,490
around each of the level crossings about

48
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:06,988
how we can capture more job

49
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:09,169
opportunities and that's what the

50
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,699
authority a very important part

51
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,068
the authorities work will be about

52
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,168
working at the local level as well as

53
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:17,808
having that doing the big picture work

54
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,457
on the business plan and looking at how

55
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,470
we're going to get those 50 level

56
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:25,569
crossings removed across the Melbourne

57
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:25,568
rail network over the next eight years
