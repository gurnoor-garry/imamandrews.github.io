00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,679
hi I'm Dan Andrews it's been a busy year

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,440
for me as it's been for so many

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,698
Victorians I'm really looking forward to

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,499
spending some time with the people that

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,678
I love the people that are so special to

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,109
me in my life my wife Katherine our kids

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,690
now are Grace and Joe that's what the

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,100
holiday season is all about it's also

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,858
about being thankful for the blessings

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,260
you have and being generous with the

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,489
things you give to others behind me is a

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,889
Kmart Wishing Tree

13
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,139
since came-up began the appeal more than

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,710
25 years ago they've collected more than

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,630
6 million gifts for needy families for

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,759
kids who need that special helping hand

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,139
at Christmastime I hope that we've all

18
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,689
done our bit in the Victorian Government

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,100
in the Premier's office to keep these

20
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,679
presents coming I know they're going to

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,300
go to kids who really need them so my

22
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,348
message to Victorian families is very

23
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,839
simple really

24
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,569
enjoy this special time with family and

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,699
friends take time to reflect on all that

26
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,558
you've achieved this year and all those

27
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,768
things in your life and the life of

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,088
those you love which is so special take

29
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,149
time also to think about those

30
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,219
