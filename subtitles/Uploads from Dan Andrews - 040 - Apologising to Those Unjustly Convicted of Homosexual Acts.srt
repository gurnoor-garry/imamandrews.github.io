1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,419
Today, we're going to do something very
important.

2
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:10,650
Homosexuality used to be illegal in Victoria.
Homosexual acts were routinely and ruthlessly

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,619
punished by the government, the police and
the courts.

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,800
Young men were sent to jail, sometimes for
up to fifteen years.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,730
Others were fined, charged, sentenced, sacked,
shunned – and ruined.

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,929
It was state-sanctioned homophobia.
And this wasn't a century ago – this was

7
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,050
in my lifetime, possibly in yours.
Today, we're going to apologise on behalf

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,129
of parliaments and governments past for
the laws we made, the lives we wrecked.

9
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,180
It'll be the first full and formal apology
of its kind anywhere in the world.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,559
And it won't make things right, but it's the
right thing to do, because in our state – equality

11
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,370
is not negotiable.
We'll try to get the video of the apology

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,969
or a transcript up on my Facebook
as soon as it’s done.

13
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,090
Or you can tune in to the Victorian Parliament
website at 2pm to watch it live.

14
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,190
This is more than a simple gesture – it's
a powerful statement of responsibility.

15
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,750
Legal homophobia began here, in this Parliament.
It has to end here, too.
