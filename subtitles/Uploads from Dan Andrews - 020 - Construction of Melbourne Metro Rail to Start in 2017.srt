00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,330
Today, I'm really pleased to announce that
an expression of interest for early important

2
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:28,180
construction works to move power, water, storm
water, gas and a whole range of other services

3
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:34,180
to relocate those services from the Melbourne
Metro alignment, that expression of interest

4
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,870
will go to the market tomorrow. We expect
that program of works will be in the order

5
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,860
of around $300 million â€“ of course there's
a tender process to be gone through, but that

6
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,820
will be the order of it. It's a very significant
investment and it just shows that we are wasting

7
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,680
no time at all. Not one day will be wasted
in delivering a world-class public transport

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,620
system for the world's most livable city.

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Protecting around 150 different sorts of utility

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,000
services underneath the ground is so important
to do this work now, to get this expression

11
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:17,030
of interest out to market now, to see these
works undertaken in 2017, but most critically

12
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,340
to see these works completed by 2018 so we
can hit the ground running with the major

13
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:29,330
construction program that is scheduled to
start in 2018. It's a big job, it's going

14
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,979
to mean there will be some disruption, particularly
in and around the areas of the portal entrances,

15
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,860
but we have to do this now and provide this
program of works so that we can see Melbourne

16
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,420
Metro up and running.
