00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,320
MEG: The message that I would give to new patients

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:12,120
would be to take each day, each diagnosis, each treatment at a time.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,100
Not to worry too much about what might happen, not worry about the what ifs.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,260
CLARE: You're in the best possible place with the best possible people, the best possible research

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,640
and you'll be able to help you achieve the best possible outcomes for you.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,920
JOHN: Cancer patients, in my experience,

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,060
are the most patient, tolerant people in the world.

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,000
And we all want it to happen tomorrow, but it ain't gonna happen tomorrow.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,280
And we're going to be patient and wait for it to happen.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,860
MEG: My message to all staff would be

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,960
to listen to your patients,

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,640
to treat them as the people that they are,

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,180
not the diagnosis, not the patients that you might see in front of you.

14
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,780
Each of them has their own story, their own life, their own family, their own backgrounds.

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,840
Think about them as people.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,760
JOHN: Peter Mac is working wonders.

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,420
I call my case a miracle.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
This place can work miracles.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,420
Never give up hope.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm way out there on a limb.

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,520
There's nothing out here â€“ except this place.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,940
And this is my future.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,120
And that's what I wrote on a rock, a message for lots of people.

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,160
This place is my future. It's my future life.
