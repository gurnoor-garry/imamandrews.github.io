1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,520
there's something else I want to talk to

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,410
you about today something that's so

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,179
wrong it obscures everything else that

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:16,198
is right and that's family violence I

5
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:19,697
should let you know that what I'm about

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,299
to say may be distressing for some

7
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:28,109
family violence is a national emergency

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:32,270
family violence ruins lives family

9
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:35,399
violence kills all of you in this room

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,279
know someone you know a victim and you

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,629
may know them well but you might not

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,070
know who I'm heartened of course by the

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,219
many campaigns that have bought

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,550
awareness to it but these campaigns have

15
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:54,770
told us something else as well awareness

16
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:59,429
means little if the system is broken and

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:03,270
our system is thousands of dedicated

18
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:06,688
workers and volunteers dozens of

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,630
important services they work hard to

20
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:13,077
make things better but the system is

21
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:16,138
still broken it doesn't protect the

22
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:21,088
vulnerable and it doesn't punish the

23
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:24,538
guilty it's failing we won't fix it

24
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,899
until we admit it now I may be

25
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:33,629
criticized for saying that and I don't

26
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:36,989
care I simply don't we expect victims to

27
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:41,898
make a deeply personal and terrifying

28
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:45,328
leap to come forward to seek protection

29
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:47,549
but we're not doing our bit we're not

30
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:52,608
there to catch them when they make that

31
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:55,828
leap instead those seeking help and

32
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:58,707
assistance fall into endless waiting

33
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:02,217
lists a support network that's

34
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:05,789
underfunded a police force that's under

35
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:10,218
pressure and intervention orders that

36
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:13,890
often mean nothing it's a betrayal

37
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:16,609
that's the reason why we always witness

38
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:21,148
these tragedies hours too late on our

39
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:24,840
evening news played before us and an

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:28,079
audience of millions news stories filled

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,708
with old photographs and the thoughtful

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,390
words of loved ones for short films of

43
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:40,189
our greatest failure so many families

44
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:43,198
have met tragedy we must remember them

45
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:46,589
and we must remember to those in newer

46
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:51,589
relationships who might be slowly losing

47
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:55,140
their freedom slowly losing themselves

48
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:59,720
too many are later described as the

49
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:02,308
victims of unexpected isolated incidents

50
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:05,638
well there's nothing unexpected or

51
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:09,239
isolated about it this is a vicious

52
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:13,528
pattern think about some of these words

53
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:18,360
from survivors we weren't allowed to cry

54
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:22,619
inside the house I couldn't leave he'd

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:26,549
taken my keys gradually he made me

56
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:30,530
believe that I had no friends he thought

57
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:34,380
it was what husbands were allowed to do

58
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:38,190
these words tell us that Family Violence

59
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:44,339
can come in any form it can creep into

60
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:47,339
any home it can happen to anyone I'll

61
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,340
never forget how I felt on that routine

62
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,040
weekday evening when I heard what had

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,840
happened on a suburban cricket ground to

64
00:03:53,039 --> 00:04:03,077
an ordinary boy who loved his mum and

65
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,078
loved his dad when I got home that night

66
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:11,370
when I got home that night all I wanted

67
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:16,140
to do was wake up my kids and hold them

68
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:19,738
close nothing is more honest than the

69
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:24,629
loyalty of a child and nothing hurts

70
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:27,449
more than its betrayal 15 children known

71
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:30,829
to DHS 15

72
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:33,868
vulnerable children died this year and

73
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:39,329
family violence was a factor in 12 of

74
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:40,950
those tragedies it's unthinkable when

75
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:43,439
family violence is committed against

76
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:48,659
women and their children it diminishes

77
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:54,058
us all because it is our problem and it

78
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:57,359
is a crime it's forty percent of police

79
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,819
work it's the leading contributor to

80
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,440
death and disability in Australian women

81
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:08,188
under 45 one woman is murdered by her

82
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:11,879
current or former partner each and every

83
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:15,389
week one in four children witness

84
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:19,768
violence against a parent and that's a

85
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:21,839
form of violence in itself we have to

86
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:24,479
admit that if women and their children

87
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:28,249
were being systematically tormented by

88
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:34,530
total strangers we would be quick to act

89
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:36,089
we would do more instead tonight women

90
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:39,658
and their children will huddle in sparse

91
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:42,449
hotel rooms and refuges briefly away

92
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,980
from the violence but never further away

93
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:48,658
from a loving and caring home tonight

94
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,899
sons and daughters will lock themselves

95
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,539
in their rooms their perception of the

96
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:57,498
most formative adult relationship in

97
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:01,889
their young lives forever scarred

98
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,389
forever changed tonight Victoria Police

99
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:06,898
will respond to around a hundred

100
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:09,749
incidents of violence and abuse doing

101
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:14,189
the best they can without the resources

102
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:16,740
they need next week intervention orders

103
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:19,589
will be made and intervention orders

104
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,070
will be breached men will be referred to

105
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:25,428
behavior change programs in reality

106
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:28,609
they'll be referred to waiting lists

107
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:32,939
lists that are longer than is safe

108
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:35,100
longer than is acceptable tomorrow many

109
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:39,599
victims will be too scared to call out

110
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,309
for help others will be too ashamed some

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,330
will take the leap

112
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:49,329
but all will be one way or another let

113
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:54,218
down by a system that simply cannot cope

114
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:57,399
and cannot protect for some there may be

115
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,279
no tomorrow and what are the politicians

116
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:04,227
doing well we're posing for photographs

117
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:09,548
and we're wearing a ribbon but we're not

118
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:12,159
asking the really hard questions some

119
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,090
people think the chief duty of a

120
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,770
government is to maintain law and order

121
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:22,648
well the biggest law and order issue in

122
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:25,358
our state is unfolding inside our homes

123
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:29,258
when we see it on the TV we don't know

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:33,098
what to say the truth is we don't know

125
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:36,909
what to do either we don't have all the

126
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:39,628
answers friends I cannot promise to keep

127
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:43,448
every woman and her children safe I

128
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:47,679
cannot promise to make sure every family

129
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:51,900
is free of violence but I'm prepared to

130
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,899
try it's time

131
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:17,930
it is time to change it all that's why

132
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:20,778
today I announce that a Victorian Labour

133
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:24,229
government will establish Australia's

134
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:26,469
first royal commission into family

135
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,470
violence

136
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:47,320
and nothing will be off limits the

137
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,129
Family Violence Royal Commission will

138
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,100
examine our system from the ground up it

139
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:56,379
will investigate criminal law

140
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,069
Corrections and the courts it will look

141
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:02,258
at support services the health system

142
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:06,760
alcohol and drug treatment it will look

143
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:09,308
at refuges housing and education and of

144
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:12,308
course it will look at the resources and

145
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:16,688
the tools that are available to our

146
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:19,478
dedicated Victoria Police a panel of

147
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,648
survivors and support provider's will

148
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,859
advise and assist the Royal Commission

149
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:28,328
it will begin its work early next year

150
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:33,659
reporting to Parliament and to all

151
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:36,159
Victorians by the end of 2015 and a

152
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:40,647
Victorian Labour government will

153
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,647
implement its recommendations

154
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:57,978
the Commission will take time but there

155
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:01,110
are some things that simply cannot wait

156
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,430
that's why I intend to make more

157
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:07,680
announcements on this critical issue

158
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:10,079
that's why back in December I appointed

159
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,749
a dedicated standalone Shadow Minister

160
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:17,509
for the Prevention of family violence

161
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,509
our colleague and friend Daniel Green

162
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,840
that's why friends that's why this

163
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,169
ministry in government will be in the

164
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:34,410
Department of premier and cabinet at the

165
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:37,399
heart of our government and at the

166
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:41,428
center at the center of our agenda

167
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,828
that's why I two of the state as part of

168
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:46,049
our labor cares program meeting with

169
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:50,009
those affected by family violence and

170
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:53,549
the people who support them they must be

171
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:58,378
acknowledged the many organizations and

172
00:10:53,549 --> 00:11:00,718
individuals who work so hard people like

173
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:03,529
Fiona McCormick a domestic-violence

174
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,530
Victoria

175
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:14,139
and of course the dedicated men and

176
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:18,358
women of Victoria Police these people

177
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:20,978
these Victorians save lives every day

178
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,100
the Royal Commission will honor their

179
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:29,470
work the Royal Commission will give us

180
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:31,859
the answers we desperately need just a

181
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,359
few weeks ago I visited my old school

182
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:38,350
and I told the students they're the most

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:41,770
important thing I've ever learned if you

184
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:47,529
have the opportunity then you have the

185
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:51,448
obligation we can do more and we must do

186
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:55,418
more on this important issue because

187
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:57,969
once every so often a genuine crisis

188
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:01,539
erupts in the most powerful way

189
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:04,739
imaginable when that happens our

190
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:09,458
obligation to do something becomes

191
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:13,359
overwhelming friends that time has come

192
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:16,420
I will never forget what happened a few

193
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,569
months ago to an eleven-year-old boy on

194
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:24,218
a cricket ground and I'll never forget

195
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:27,459
meeting with his remarkable mum his

196
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:32,080

198
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:40,660

199
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:44,350
family we must listen long enough to

200
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:49,268
hear the deafening whisper in thousands

201
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:52,439
more we hear it and we are going to do

202
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,438
something about it

203
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:06,560
we're going to do something about it

204
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:10,959
because the time has come to put people

205
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,959

206
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:19,609

207
