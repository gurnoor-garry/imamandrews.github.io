00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:08,320
After a 12 month international competitive
tender process, I am very pleased that these

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,190
High Capacity Metro Trains, 65 trains, $2
billion worth of work. That work has been

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:21,640
won by the consortium led by Downer and that
work will be undertaken in this workshop right

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,000
here.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,419
Those 65 trains are an extra carriage long,
they have a 20% increase in the overall capacity,

6
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:35,180
what does that mean? Well on the Cranbourne
Pakenham line, where they'll run from the

7
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:42,450
beginning of 2019, we will see 39,000 extra
passengers able to travel on that, our busiest

8
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,630
line.

9
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,870
These are the trains that will service the
Metro Tunnel when we connect the Dandenong

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,940
line with the Sunbury line. They'll have the
latest technology, the latest design, there

11
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,110
will be better information for passengers
within the trains themselves, contributing

12
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:02,760
overall to a better public transport experience.
So we're not just getting new trains, made

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,800
proudly in Victoria by Victorians, we're also
breathing new life into the rolling stock

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,420
industry here in this state.

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:20,620
The overall job number on this contract is
1,100 jobs. 15% of those jobs will be apprentices,

16
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:27,250
trainees or cadet engineers. This is all good,
strong news.

17
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:35,870
Trains for Victorians built by Victorians.
