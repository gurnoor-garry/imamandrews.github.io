1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,400
The Victorian Government is upgrading and widening the Monash Freeway to get you home safer and sooner.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,840
The project is upgrading 44
kilometres of the Monash Freeway

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,180
between Chadstone and Pakenham.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,240
During the construction of extra lanes,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,440
your commute will change with 30 kilometres of
barriers in place to keep drivers and workers safe.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,500
The same number of lanes will
remain open during the peak,

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,200
and construction will be staged
to avoid major disruption.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,440
Plan your trip ahead and leave
a little more time just in case.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,880
We'll have you moving sooner
with works finishing in 2018.

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,200
By upgrading the Monash and
building the Western Distributor Tunnel,

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,440
we'll reduce congestion, and improve safety and reliability from Geelong to Pakenham.

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,860
Stay in touch with the Monash Freeway upgrade to find out about changes that may affect you.
