00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,279
Melbourne is to get its own version of the
New York Police Department's high-tech crime

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:12,070
fighting nerve centre. The Premier and Victoria
Police have conceded they need to do more

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,120
in the fight against street gangs.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,660
Wearing a bulletproof vest, the Premier rode along

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,980
with some of New York's finest to see how
serious they are about fighting crime.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,500
The New York Police Department's Real Time Crime
Control Center utilises more than 8000 cameras,

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:36,050
including gunshot sensors and 35 different
databases to keep on top of the crooks.

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:42,560
And Victoria will be getting its own version of the high-tech crime fighting centre from early next year.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,580
To make sure that our dedicated
Victoria Police have got everything they need

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,430
â€“ resources and the intelligence, the information
and the data.

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,410
Victoria's Assistant Commissioner Debra Abbott says a new nerve centre could detect events

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,610
such as the Moomba riots.

13
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:05,930
It certainly will give us real time intelligence
and information that we currently really don't

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,000
have a handle on.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,600
The NYPD also has a joint
operations centre used during major events,

16
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:17,600
presidential visits and public incidents.
New York City and Victoria are members of

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,350
the Strong Cities Network, which was formed
last year to share information around the

18
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,450
world about potential terrorism threats. Chief
Thomas Galati says more information keeps

19
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,840
the community and police officers as safe
as possible.

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,119
It makes the course of investigations,

21
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,619
of policing just in general much quicker and
much safer.
