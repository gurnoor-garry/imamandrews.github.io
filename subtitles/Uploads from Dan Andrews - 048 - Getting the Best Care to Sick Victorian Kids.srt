1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,200
The Royal Children's will team up with the
Boston Children's Hospital to help improve

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,199
care for sick kids. Hospital chief Christine
Kilpatrick flew to the United States to make

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,039
the announcement alongside Premier Daniel Andrews.

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,439
State political reporter Andrew Lund was there.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,140
Armed with dozens of koalas and
kangaroos, Daniel Andrews discovered Boston

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,520
kids can be tough customers.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,240
I got another stuffed animal in my bag.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,420
The Premier was visiting the Boston Children's Hospital to mark a new partnership with

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,660
the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,880
There's no doubt in medicine and in health generally today it's all about collaboration.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,280
We have a whole set of digital
opportunities, telehealth opportunities,

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,540
communications that were never available before.
And so crossing that great ocean is going

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,260
to be much easier than in the past.

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,320
The two hospitals plan
to collaborate to improve safety

15
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,449
and quality standards as well as
expanding their education offering.

16
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,449
Dedicated to improving the lives of children

17
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,109
from prevention all the way
through the most complex care.

18
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:10,080
Boston is a world-leader in medical research. This
facility has used zebra fish to unlock treatments

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,580
for cancer and muscular dystrophy. The State
Government hopes Victoria can tap into that knowledge.

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,100
There are eight important memorandums
of understanding, so important deals that

21
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,100
formalise partnerships, take partnerships
to the next level. The Government has also

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,880
The Government has also announced an $80 million joint enterprise between Monash University and

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,780
the University of Melbourne designed to accelerate the development of new medicines.

24
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,040
The partnership is expected

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,070
to generate around $360 million worth of activity
over the next decade, which the Government

26
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,640
says will support the development of new companies
and jobs, as well as inreased investment and exports.

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,060
We have some of the best science
anywhere in the world, some of the best people

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,060
who are doing great work. We need to keep
more of that value chain in our local area.

29
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,300
In Boston, Andrew Lund, Nine News.
