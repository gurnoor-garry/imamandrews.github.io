1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,960
Victoria will once again become a national
leader on climate change and play its part

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,760
in a worldwide movement to reduce emissions
and keep the global temperature rise to under

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,810
2 degrees.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:15,450
TAKE2 is Victoria's historic government-led
climate change pledge to reach our long-term

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,040
target of net zero emissions by 2050.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,800
To achieve this, we must take advantage of
Victoria's existing clean energy resources

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,190
and support new energy technologies.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,390
We need businesses to innovate and develop
industries for the future, because this will

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,899
create demand for new jobs and skills to support
our move to a low carbon economy.

10
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,579
All of us have a role to play and with practical
action from communities, businesses and governments

11
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,710
we can achieve this together.

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:48,460
We must take decisive action because we ignore
climate change at our peril. Future generations

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,909
of Victorians deserve a government that is
prepared for the challenges and opportunities

14
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:53,420
that lie ahead of us.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,299
I encourage you to join us, pledge and share
it with others.

16
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,329
It's time for us all to act.

17
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:04,729
It's time for us all to TAKE2 now, at take2.vic.gov.au.
