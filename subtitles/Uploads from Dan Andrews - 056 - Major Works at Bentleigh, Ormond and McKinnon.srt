1
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,660
This is a massive project. It's the largest
rail shut down — which we'll be undertaking

2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,730
in the next few weeks — since the construction
of the Melbourne underground rail network

3
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,279
back in the '80s, so we're very excited about
that. In the 37 days, we'll be excavating

4
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,910
out to lower the rail line to 7 metres deep
below its existing level. We'll be digging

5
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:40,470
out about 260,000 m³ of excavated material
and taking it away from the site in trucks,

6
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,540
so expect to see a lot of trucks on the road
for that period. We're working 24/7 with up

7
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,540
to 1000 people onsite in a shift. We understand
that's going to be quite disruptive for the

8
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,620
community and traders. We'll be building the
new railway line and starting to build the

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,630
three new stations. And at the end of the
37 days, we'll be opening the first station

10
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,970
here at McKinnon Road.

11
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,200
North Road, McKinnon Road
and Centre Road traders, they're still

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,509
open for business during the major construction
works and the road closures that are involved.

13
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:12,070
There will be increased traffic with trucks,
but there is still plenty of parking available

14
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,450
for customers during that time.

15
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,890
We've got lots of workers with their parking so making sure that we're not blocking the residents from being

16
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,000
able to access their homes and keeping everything safe.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
We make a bit of mess on
the road. Straight away, we get the sweepers

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,260
over, clean it up, try to make as little as
possible damage to them.

19
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,620
It will be noisy.

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,539
Understand that it's going to be disruptive
and ask that people just come to us with any

21
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:37,059
concerns they've got and we'll do our best
to respond.

22
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,340
Our community relations team will be on call 24 hours during the out of hours works and they'll be able to

23
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,480
reach our team directly during that time.

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,300
It'll make life so much easier
for cars and pedestrians and people

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,360
that live nearby. And we'll put up with the
mess at the moment because it'll be good.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,400
It is a bit of short-term pain and it's a
really big long-term gain so let's just keep

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,140
the long term in mind.
