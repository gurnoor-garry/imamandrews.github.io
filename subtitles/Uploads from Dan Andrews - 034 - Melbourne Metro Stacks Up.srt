1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,940
The business case clearly shows that this
is a project of great strength. It stacks

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,449
up, even on the most conservative of measures.
This is the best part of 4,000 jobs in Victoria,

3
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:25,070
39,000 extra passengers able to move through
the rail network every morning peak. This

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:33,859
is a really significant project and now, it's
time for us to have a true partnership between

5
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:38,980
our government, the Federal Government and
the private sector to be able to deliver this

6
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,739
and deliver it well. We've contributed $4.5
billion to this project and we'd like the

7
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,039
Federal Government to consider the business
case, to look at the positive benefits that

8
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,989
come from this amazing project, and to be
a partner with us. New York, Tokyo, London,

9
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:02,550
Paris – all of these cities are making these
sorts of investments or already have so that

10
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,860
they can have a turn up and go public transport
system. No need for a timetable – services

11
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,480
are so regular that you can simply arrive and get first class public transport where you need to go.

12
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,300
As well as being a project
that unlocks the core of our public transport

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,939
network, this is indeed a public transport
infrastructure project for the whole of the

14
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,579
state. There are benefits for the outer suburbs
that are growing quickly. For regional Victorians,

15
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,210
they will have access to the Parkville precinct,
the important medical and education precinct.

16
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,409
They'll be able to catch a train there for
the first time. You'll be able to get on a

17
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:53,340
train in Gippsland, get on a train in Ballarat
and come into that precinct in a way people

18
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,619
have not been able to access before. These
are just some of the many examples of why

19
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:07,369
we need to push on with Melbourne Metro to
deliver more services, but also increase reliability

20
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:09,549
across our public transport system.
