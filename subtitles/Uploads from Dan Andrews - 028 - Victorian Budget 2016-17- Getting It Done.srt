1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,510
The Victorian people elected us to rebuild
schools and hospitals, cut congestion and

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,379
create more jobs.
That's what really matters.

3
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,820
And we’re getting it done.
We’re not going to sit on the sidelines.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,190
Instead we're creating thousands of jobs by getting
on with the projects our state needs.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,199
And we’re working with businesses directly
– helping them get the investment they need

6
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,530
to create new jobs, and helping Victorians
get the skills they need to fill them.

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,320
That starts at school.
We’re funding the biggest investment in

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,980
new school buildings in Victorian history.
Because our kids won’t get a first-rate

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,460
education in a second-rate classroom.
We’re funding special schools, too - because

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,840
every student deserves every chance.
We're upgrading hospitals, making sure more

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,670
people get the surgery they need sooner.
And cutting waiting times in the emergency

12
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,320
department. Because we all need a health system we can rely on.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,040
Something else we all rely on is of course

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,619
our transport system.
And we’re funding a massive investment in

15
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:14,700
roads and public transport too.
It’s all about getting you home safer and

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,100
sooner, and giving you more options to get
from A to B.

17
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,110
Everyone has a right to safety.
Family violence is the biggest law and

18
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,320
order issue confronting our nation.
We made a huge change – funding an unprecedented

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,700
$572 million to keep women and children safe
and to punish the perpetrators of this hideous

20
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,009
crime. And we’re also working hard to make our

21
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:50,630
whole state safer as well, recruiting more
police and giving them the powers and resources

22
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,939
they need to fight crime and keep Victoria
safe.

23
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:00,220
We care about the things that matter most
to Victorians – jobs, health, education,

24
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,110
transport and quality of life.
There’s a lot of work to do.

25
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,730
And we are getting it done.
