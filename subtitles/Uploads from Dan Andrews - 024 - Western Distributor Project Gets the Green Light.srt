1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,179
The Victorian Government will partner with
Transurban to build the Western Distributor.

2
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:15,629
Together with the Monash Freeway upgrade,
this will streamline the M1 from Geelong to

3
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:21,260
Pakenham. This massive project will provide
a much-needed alternative to the West Gate

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:28,920
Bridge and create 5,600 jobs. The project
will include widening the West Gate Freeway

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,420
from 8 to 12 lanes, a tunnel under Yarraville,
a bridge over the Maribyrnong and direct access

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,929
to the Port of Melbourne, an elevated road
along Footscray Road, an interchange with

7
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:51,649
CityLink and access to the city. The Western
Distributor will slash travel times by up

8
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:59,140
to 20 minutes, take up to 6,000 trucks off
the West Gate Bridge and up to 6,000 trucks

9
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:06,540
off local streets in the inner west, as well
as completing the Federation Trail for cyclists.

10
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,310
Community consultation will guide the final
design. Construction on the Monash Freeway

11
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:19,170
section will start in 2016 with the Western
Distributor starting in 2018. The Western

12
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,030
Distributor will cut travel times and create
thousands of jobs for Victorians.
