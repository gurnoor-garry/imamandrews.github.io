1
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:16,838
today I'm very pleased to announce I'm

2
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:20,150
proud to announce that we will invest

3
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:21,648
significantly to remove 9 level

4
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:23,778
crossings all the level crossings

5
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:25,937
between Caulfield and Daniel on will go

6
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:28,428
they'll be put out to the market as one

7
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:30,049
package of works those 9 level crossings

8
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:33,497
will go that that work will be finished

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,530
by the end of 2018 will order 37

10
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:39,018
high-capacity trains this is the very

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,030
best of new technology to make sure that

12
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:43,428
we can move more passengers and get them

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:47,389
to their destination faster these trains

14
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:49,488
will be made locally a minimum 50% local

15
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:51,379
content target on build and of course

16
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:54,108
maintenance will be done locally there's

17
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:56,028
a Depot to be built out it's a Pakenham

18
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:58,009
there are power upgrades and

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,228
conventional signalling upgrades on this

20
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:04,337
pocket and Cranbourne line and there is

21
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:06,498
also very importantly a proper trial of

22
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:09,349
high capacity signalling on the

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,679
Sandringham line not trialing new

24
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:13,938
technology on our busiest rail line the

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,729
packet and Cranbourne line but instead

26
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:19,548
doing a discreet trial the way it should

27
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:23,029
be done on the Sandringham line so this

28
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:25,819
is good for safety it's good for traffic

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,560
congestion it's good for jobs and it's

30
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,688
good for public transport users in

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,390
Melbourne busiest and public transport

32
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:34,569
corridor I'm very very proud to be able

33
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,769
to commit our government to this

34
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:38,958
significant package of works this will

35
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:41,448
be many billions of dollars it will

36
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,568
secure jobs improve services improve

37
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,009
safety as well it's exactly what we said

38
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:51,950
it would do and we're proud to be able

39
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:53,449
to pin it to it today we're taking a

40
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,270
pathway that's about putting passengers

41
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,280
first putting in place a program of

42
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:00,498
works that's designed to address

43
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,530
congestion to increase capacity by

44
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:05,927
around 42 percent by purchasing 37

45
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,478
high-capacity trains longer trains that

46
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,518
can carry more passengers on the extra

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,068
services that will be delivered along

48
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:14,390
this line this is the careful planning

49
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:16,159
work that's gone into

50
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:18,978
delivering this program of works that's

51
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,989
needed it's a better approach it's a

52
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,179
bigger approach but most importantly

53
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,970
it's an approach that puts whether

54
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,010
you're a public transport passenger or a

55
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:29,868
motorist sitting in a car in the in the

56
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:31,609
south eastern suburbs of Melbourne this

57
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,740
will be a program that will see you get

58
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,420
to get to work quicker and get home

59
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,070
earlier to the family at the end of the

60
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:39,318
day through the program of removing

61
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,628
level crossings and the delivery of F

62
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,788
trains it's the right project for this

63
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:46,008
set for this line and it's a program

64
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:48,168
that with the premiere we are very keen

65
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:51,428
to get cracking on implementing over the

66
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:51,428
next step over the next three years
